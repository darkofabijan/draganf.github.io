# Introducing Saveaves

<small>On Saturday, January 18, 2014 by Darko Fabijan</small>

The big goal is to build web framework in Elixir that should give developers same enjoyment while developing web applications as Rails does. I know, that’s easy to say, but pretty hard to accomplish. As always with such over ambitious goals failure is definitely an option.

For sure I will have fun while writing it, but I was also thinking how can Elixir community benefit from it in case of whatever outcome. The idea that I got is to write a diary like series of blog posts will describe the process behind building each component. It’s likely that posts will be rough on the edges but than again content will be about real problems so I hope that they will be interesting. Of course anyone can join.

I am Elixir newbie and while I have been occasionally programming in Elixir and Erlang during past year I don’t have experience of running either of those languages in production. I do however have decent experience of running fairly complex distributed systems such as Semaphore. In case you don’t know it’s hosted continuous integration service. Ruby runs almost whole service with exception of one small component which is in Go. I have been also using Rails since 2008 and learned a lot from it so I would try to bake that feel of using framework into Thunder.

Let’s get to work.
